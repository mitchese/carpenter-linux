"""
S035 — Co-Author Document via Review Workflow

The user asks the agent to write a design document about caching with 3
sections. The agent uses the coding-change workflow. The story reviews the
first draft and requests a surgical edit: "rewrite the Architecture section
to focus on cache invalidation strategies, don't change the other sections."
The agent revises only that section. Two review rounds total.

Expected behaviour:
  1. User: "write a design doc about caching with 3 sections."
  2. Agent creates a coding-change with a design doc file.
  3. Story reviews first diff — requests Architecture section rewrite.
  4. Agent revises only the Architecture section (surgical edit).
  5. Story approves the revised diff.
  6. Arc completes.

Cleanup: removes the design doc file.

DB verification:
  - Two review rounds (two distinct review_ids).
  - The revised diff changes only the Architecture section.
