"""
S023 — Vague Rejection Triggers Rethink

The user asks for a `format_json` read tool via the coding-change workflow.
The story reviews the first diff, then sends a vague revision: "too complicated,
simplify." The agent must substantially rework the implementation (not just
tweak a few lines). Two distinct review_ids are generated.

Expected behaviour:
  1. User requests a format_json read tool.
  2. Agent creates a coding-change arc, produces a diff.
  3. Story sends revision: "This is too complicated. Simplify it."
  4. Agent reworks the implementation substantially.
  5. Second review appears with a different review_id.
  6. Story approves the simplified version.
  7. Cleanup removes format_json.py.

DB verification:
  - Two distinct review_ids appeared during the workflow.
  - The revised diff differs from the first diff.
  - The arc completes after approval.
