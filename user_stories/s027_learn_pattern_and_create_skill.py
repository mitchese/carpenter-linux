"""
S027 — Learn Pattern and Create KB Entry

Phase 1: The user walks the agent through a deploy flow manually —
"check git status, run tests, build, deploy." This establishes a pattern
in arc history.

Phase 2: The reflection system runs (or is triggered), identifying the
repeated pattern.

Phase 3: The user says "deploy again." The agent recognises the pattern
and may create a KB entry to document the flow, or at least replays the
steps from memory.

Expected behaviour:
  1. User walks through a deploy-like workflow step by step.
  2. Agent executes each step and records in arc history.
  3. User says "deploy again" in a later message.
  4. Agent recognises the pattern (possibly creating a KB entry) and
     replays the steps or indicates KB entry creation.

Cleanup: removes any KB entries created during the test.

DB verification:
  - Arc history shows the deploy steps.
  - Agent's "deploy again" response references prior steps or a KB entry.
