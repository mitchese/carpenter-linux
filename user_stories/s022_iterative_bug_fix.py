"""
S022 — Iterative Bug Fix (Ralph Loop)

The user reports a bug in a Celsius-to-Fahrenheit converter that produces
wrong results for negative numbers. The agent uses the impl+monitor sibling
arc pattern to iterate on the fix: implement, test, detect failure, revise,
until all test cases pass.

Formula: F = C * 9/5 + 32
Test cases: 0->32, 100->212, -40->-40, 37->98.6

Expected behaviour:
  1. User reports the bug with test cases.
  2. Agent creates a coding-change arc to fix the implementation.
  3. Agent may iterate (multiple impl+monitor cycles) to get all test
     cases passing.
  4. The final implementation correctly handles negative numbers.
  5. Story approves the diff and verifies correctness.

This is a long-running story (300s+ timeout) due to iteration.

DB verification:
  - At least one coding-change arc created.
  - The arc reaches 'waiting' with a diff for review.
  - After approval, the arc completes.
