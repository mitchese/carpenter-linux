S041 — Request Model-Specific Code Review

The user triggers a platform change (e.g., asks the agent to add a new chat
tool), which produces a coding-change arc that reaches 'waiting' status with
a diff for review. The story then asks the agent to request a review from a
specific, smarter model (e.g., "Please have Claude Sonnet review this diff
and report back the findings").

The agent creates a review arc with the specified model configured, the review
arc executes using that model, and the findings are reported back to the user.

Expected behaviour:
  1. User asks agent to add a new chat tool (e.g., 'uppercase_text').
  2. Agent creates a coding-change arc; arc reaches 'waiting' with a diff.
  3. Story asks agent: "Please have Claude Sonnet review this diff and report
     the findings back to me."
  4. Agent creates a review arc with Sonnet configured as the agent model.
  5. Review arc executes, produces findings (e.g., "code looks good", "missing
     docstring", etc.).
  6. Findings are reported back to the user in the conversation.

DB verification:
  - Coding-change root arc reaches status='waiting' (with review_id).
  - Review arc is created as a child of the coding-change arc.
  - Review arc reaches status='completed'.
  - Review arc's agent_config_id points to a config with the specified model.
  - Messages in the conversation include the review findings.

Behavioral verification:
  - Agent acknowledges the review request.
  - Response contains review findings (e.g., mentions code quality, issues,
    or approval).

NOTE: This story makes a permanent additive change to the platform source
(adds a new chat tool). Running it a second time is safe — the coding agent
will see the tool already exists and should produce a no-op or trivially
identical diff.
