S028 — Reflection Proposes Schedule

Day 1: user asks "what's the weather like today?" Day 2 (simulated):
user asks the same question again. The reflection system runs, identifies
the repeated pattern, and proposes a scheduled weather check at 6:30am
via proposed_action.

Expected behaviour:
  1. User asks about weather in conversation A.
  2. User asks about weather in conversation B (separate conv).
  3. The agent (or reflection system) recognises the pattern.
  4. A proposed_action or schedule suggestion appears — either the agent
     proactively suggests scheduling, or the reflection creates a
     proposal for a 6:30am cron.
  5. The response mentions scheduling or recurring.

Cleanup: removes any cron entries created.

DB verification:
  - Two conversations with weather queries.
  - Agent suggests or creates a recurring schedule.
