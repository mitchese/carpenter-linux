"""
S013 — User Sets Up and Cancels a Recurring Scheduled Message

The user asks Carpenter — using plain language, never saying "cron" —
to send a recurring chat message every minute in the current conversation.
The agent creates a repeating schedule using the platform's scheduling
primitives.  The user observes two messages arrive at approximately the
requested cadence, then asks the agent to stop the repeating messages
(again without using the word "cron").  The agent cancels the schedule and
confirms.  The runner verifies that the cron entry has been removed from the
database.

Step-by-step expected behaviour:
  1. User sends: "Every minute, send me a message in this conversation to
     remind me to check my posture.  Keep doing it until I tell you to stop."
  2. Agent acknowledges and uses scheduling.add_cron (or equivalent) to set
     up a recurring trigger that fires every minute.
  3. The platform fires the trigger; an arc executor sends a message containing
     "posture" to the conversation.
  4. The trigger fires again one minute later; a second posture message arrives.
  5. User sends: "Please stop sending those repeating reminders."
  6. Agent removes the recurring schedule (scheduling.remove_cron or similar).
  7. Agent confirms in natural language that the repeating task has been stopped.
  8. DB inspection shows no enabled cron entry with the "s013-posture" name
     prefix remains.

Platform capabilities exercised:
  - scheduling.add_cron  — creates a recurring minute-resolution trigger
  - scheduling.remove_cron / enable_cron — cancels the schedule
  - messaging.send       — arc sends messages to the conversation
  - Arc auto-dispatch    — trigger → work item → arc → executor → message

Known timing constraints:
  - Cron has 1-minute resolution; the first fire can be up to 60 s after setup
    depending on where in the current minute the cron entry is created.
  - The Raspberry Pi has limited CPU; arc dispatch and executor startup add
    latency.  This story uses a 5-minute window for two messages to arrive.

Cleanup: removes any cron_entries with name prefix "s013-posture" so the
story is safe to re-run.
