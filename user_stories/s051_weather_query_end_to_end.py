"""
S051 — Weather Query End-to-End

The user asks "What's the weather in Oxford, UK?" and expects the chat
agent to fetch the weather (via untrusted arc batch) and report back the
result in the same conversation — without the user sending another message.

This tests the full arc-completion → chat-notification pipeline:
  1. User asks about weather.
  2. Chat agent creates untrusted arc batch (EXECUTOR + REVIEWER + JUDGE).
  3. Arcs execute, fetching real weather data.
  4. On completion, arc.chat_notify re-invokes the chat agent.
  5. Chat agent reads arc results and delivers weather info to the user.

The story passes when the conversation contains an assistant message with
weather-related content (temperature, conditions, etc.) for Oxford.

Timeout: 300s (haiku), 300s (sonnet) — arc pipeline is multi-step.
