"""
S006 — User Asks Agent to Set a Reminder for a Specific Time

The user asks Carpenter to send them a chat message reminder in
approximately 2 minutes.  The agent must set up a mechanism that, without
any further user interaction, delivers a message to the conversation at the
requested time.

Expected behaviour:
  1. Agent acknowledges the request.
  2. Agent sets up a one-shot scheduled trigger (not a recurring cron).
  3. Approximately 2 minutes later the platform fires the trigger.
  4. A message containing the reminder text arrives in the conversation.
  5. After delivery the scheduled entry is removed (no daily recurrence).

Platform capabilities required (any of these approaches):
  - scheduling.add_once(name, at_iso, event_type="cron.message", event_payload)
      with event_payload containing {"message": "..."} — simplest approach,
      directly delivers message to conversation. conversation_id auto-injected.
  - scheduling.add_once(name, at_iso, event_type="arc.dispatch", event_payload)
      with an EXECUTOR arc that calls messaging.send — more flexible but heavier.
  - scheduling.add_cron with a mechanism for the arc to remove itself
      after firing (the recurring workaround).

Known gaps as of 2026-03-18:
  - scheduling.add_once does not exist; only recurring add_cron is available.
  - Cron expressions have 1-minute resolution — a cron targeting :XX minutes
    may fire up to 59 seconds late.
  - A recurring cron entry will re-fire at the same time every day unless the
    arc removes it after first delivery.

This story will FAIL if those gaps have not been addressed.  The failure
diagnostic will show which step blocked progress, making it a useful
specification for the feature work required.

Cleanup: removes any cron_entries created during this test by name prefix
"s006-reminder" so the test is safe to re-run.
